        Checks new user registrations against the <a>StopForumSpam</a> database. If either the <code>confidence</code> or <code>frequency</code> thresholds are reached, the user is prevented from completing their registration on your forum.

        SSO register via <code>fof/oauth</code> and <code>fof/passport</code> is also supported. Other SSO providers should work, but are untested.

        The number of spam reports between all enabled checks that will trip the spam filter.
        Ex: If the email has 1 hit, and the ip has 2 hits, there will be 3 hits in total. If the threshold is set to 3 or less we will prevent the registration.

      regional_endpoint_label: Geographic Access
      regional_endpoint_help: By default we will direct the lookup to the closest regional server in order to provide the fastest response. Should you wish to restrict traffic to a specific region, such as for compliance with company or country privacy regulations, then you can force a connection to a specific region.

      confidence_label: Confidence
      confidence_help: The confidence score is a reasonably good indicator that the field under test would result in unwanted activity. Set your confidence level as a percentage. If the field is equal or above this figure, the registration will be blocked, regardless on the 'frequency' test above.

      email_hash_label: Use hashed email address
      email_hash_help: Pass a MD5 hash of the email address should you wish to not pass the email address itself. This method bypasses all blacklists, normalisation and obfuscation bypass checks.
